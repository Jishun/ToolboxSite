# ToolboxSite
  - Under construction
  - Building a place to collect some handy utilities code as little tools which can come to help during daily programming and trouble shooting
  - The current approach is: Try to implement typical ideas with javascript and host it in [gh-pages branch](https://Jishun.github.io/ToolboxSite/)

## What's available for use
  1. Sql small data copy tool
    - A small code logic to convert a SELECT statement result string into an INSERT statement string.
    - Just done the first step, only SQL server syntax available
    - Going to add other SQL syntax support
  2. Encoding and Decoding
    - Provide a quick access to encoding or decodeing a string using xml/html/url/base64/base32/csv etc..

## Contribute
   - It'll be a big support if anyone would like to contribute an idea to this collection, by creating an issue here describing a requirement
   - Or send a pull request to me with a react-component which hosts an idea.
